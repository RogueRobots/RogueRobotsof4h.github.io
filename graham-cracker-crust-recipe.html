    <h1>Graham Cracker Crust</h1>
    
    <h2>Why This Recipe Works</h2>
    <p>
      Saving time is always a good idea&mdash;just as long as you're not sacrifcing quality. But
      while store-bought graham cracker pie crusts are tempting (all you have to do is fill, chill,
      and serve), they taste stale and bland. We wanted a fresh-tasting homemade crust that wasn't
      too sweet, with a crisp texture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, a classic graham cracker crust couldn't be easier to make: Combine crushed crumbs
      with a little butter and sugar to bind them, then use a measuring cup or flat-bottomed glass
      to pack the crumbs into the pie plate. And producing a perfect graham cracker crust has a lot
      to do with the graham crackers used. After experimenting with three leading brands, we
      discovered subtle differences among them and found that these differences carried over into
      crumb crusts made with each kind of cracker. Here in the test kitchen, we prefer Nabisco
      Original Graham Crackers for their hearty molasses flavor.

      We don't recommend using store-bought graham cracker crumbs here as they can often be stale.
      Be sure to note whether the crust needs to be warm or cool before filling (the pie recipes
      will specify) and plan accordingly.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>8 whole graham crackers, broken into 1-inch squares</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the over to 325 degrees. Process the
        graham cracker pieces in a food processor to fine, even crumbs, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the
        butter and sugar over the crumbs and pulse to incorporate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the mixture into a 9-inch pie plate. Use the bottom of a measuring cup to press the
        crumbs into an even layer on the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Bake until the crust is
        fragrant and beginning to brown, 13 to 18 minutes. Following the particular pie recipe, use
        the crust while it is still warm or let it cool completely.
